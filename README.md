# Linked List

This is a project for learning how to create a linked list, as explained in the Computer Science curriculum from [The Odin Project][1]. This is mostly for the sake of learning basic computer science principles in terms of algorithms and data structures.

The linked list will consist of nodes that hold data and a reference to the node that comes after it, as well as knowing which nodes are the "head" and "tail" of the list. The list will contain several methods such as #append, #prepend, #size, and more.

The original project page from the curriculum can be [found here][2].
